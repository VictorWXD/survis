        "abstract": "Building of university timetable is one of the problems that are difficult to be solved because of the large number of lectures and conflicts between them. This makes it difficult to introduce schedule-building restrictions that consume time and effort for table production. Many methods have been suggested that the computer is used to solve this problem, including a Genetic Algorithm (GA) where the main purpose of the algorithm is to reduce the number of conflicts in the timesheet and to reduce the search space encoding. This paper proposes an automated system to build a faculty timetable using a genetic algorithm. A genetic algorithm had been used to schedule the timetable of the faculty of engineering and information technology with a dynamic chromosome size that is flexible with the course numbers of each department. This algorithm can be applied in different institutions (i.e. faculties, or institutes) According to their limitations. The proposed system achieved great results during the evaluation phase of around 93% compared to manual scheduling or the systems available.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, a new hybrid algorithm (NHA) combining genetic algorithm with local search and using events based on groupings of students is described to solve the university course timetabling problem. A list of events such as lectures, tutorials, laboratories and seminars are ordered and mutually disjoint groups of students taking them are formed in such a way that once a student is selected in any group, he is excluded from further selection in other groups. The union of all the events taken by all the students of each group is formed. The number of events in each group is termed as its group size whose upper bound is restricted by the total number of timeslots and can be reduced to the maximum number of events per student. The above process of forming groups is repeated till the size of each group is reduced within this bound by not choosing those events which are common for all the students in the group. Now, the genetic algorithm with local search (GALS) is applied on a number of benchmark problems. The experimental results show that our algorithm, NHA, is able to produce promising results when compared with the results obtained by using GALS and other existing algorithms.",

        "abstract": "The university course timetabling problem (UCTP) schedules a set of events into timeslots and suitable rooms under various constraints according to the student enrollment such that the possibility of allocations is maximized. It is solved by introducing an innovative idea based on students groupings and then using ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithm. Disjoint groups of students, based on selected events, are created in such a manner that a student must belong to exactly one group. This procedure is executed by excluding the student from the further selection, once it is selected in a group. Events obtained after this grouping of students are assigned to timeslots and rooms by applying the ACO algorithm. The proposed algorithm is tested on a number of benchmark UCTP instances. The fitness function value is used as a performance measure. Each problem instance is run independently for several times and the solution among them with the least value of fitness function is selected as the solution of that problem instance. It is found that the proposed algorithm is computationally efficient when compared with other existing algorithms.",

        "abstract": "University course timetabling problem (UCTP) is considered to be a hard combinatorial optimization problem to assign a set of events to a set of rooms and timeslots. Although several methods have been investigated, due to the nature of UCTP, memetic computing techniques have been more effective. A key feature of memetic computing is the hybridization of a population-based global search and the local improvement. Such hybridization is expected to strike a balance between exploration and exploitation of the search space. In this paper, a memetic computing technique that is designed for UCTP, called the hybrid harmony search algorithm (HHSA), is proposed. In HHSA, the harmony search algorithm (HSA), which is a metaheuristic population-based method, has been hybridized by: 1) hill climbing, to improve local exploitation; and 2) a global-best concept of particle swarm optimization to improve convergence. The results were compared against 27 other methods using the 11 datasets of Socha et al. comprising five small, five medium, and one large datasets. The proposed method achieved the optimal solution for the small dataset with comparable results for the medium datasets. Furthermore, in the most complex and large datasets, the proposed method achieved the best results.",

        "abstract": "This paper is concerned with the application of an automated hybrid approach in addressing the university timetabling problem. The approach described is based on the nature-inspired artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm. An ABC algorithm is a biologically-inspired optimization approach, which has been widely implemented in solving a range of optimization problems in recent years such as job shop scheduling and machine timetabling problems. Although the approach has proven to be robust across a range of problems, it is acknowledged within the literature that there currently exist a number of inefficiencies regarding the exploration and exploitation abilities. These inefficiencies can often lead to a slow convergence speed within the search process. Hence, this paper introduces a variant of the algorithm which utilizes a global best model inspired from particle swarm optimization to enhance the global exploration ability while hybridizing with the great deluge (GD) algorithm in order to improve the local exploitation ability. Using this approach, an effective balance between exploration and exploitation is attained. In addition, a traditional local search approach is incorporated within the GD algorithm with the aim of further enhancing the performance of the overall hybrid method. To evaluate the performance of the proposed approach, two diverse university timetabling datasets are investigated, i.e., Carter's examination timetabling and Socha course timetabling datasets. It should be noted that both problems have differing complexity and different solution landscapes. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is capable of producing high quality solutions across both these benchmark problems, showing a good degree of generality in the approach. Moreover, the proposed method produces best results on some instances as compared with other approaches presented in the literature.",

It takes a lot of time and is required for every semester that is of six months. Thus, a lot of time and manpower is taken up by this process. In some cases, the manual process of creating timetables is too cumbersome. Creating temporary timetables when a faculty is on leave is impractical. In this paper, we have created an algorithm to generate timetables which can save a lot of time and pressure on the person doing this job manually. A software-based approach is better, as a computer can process data and churn out results at a much higher rate with greater accuracy. Also, it can be coded and optimized as per requirements set by different universities and the base code will remain the same.",
